## Welcome to the Zeta Foundation!

We are a non-profit organization focusing on the creation of Python-based development tools to empower future data science research.
Currently, our main project is Vivo: The First Full-Stack Neuromorphic Computing Framework. This allows for the simple creation of SNNs and Neuromorphic Accelerators.
